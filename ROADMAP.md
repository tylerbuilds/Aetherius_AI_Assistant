# Aetherius AI Assistant - Project Roadmap

## Current Status: ‚úÖ SETUP COMPLETE - Basic Functionality Working!

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Repository cloned successfully
- [x] Virtual environment created
- [x] Core Python packages installed
- [x] Environment variables configured in `.env`
- [x] Basic package imports verified
- [x] **FIXED:** `aiofiles` - Required for async file operations
- [x] **FIXED:** `PyAudio` - Audio processing (installed with PortAudio system dependency)
- [x] **FIXED:** `openai-whisper` - Speech recognition (compatible version found)
- [x] **FIXED:** Path separator issues - Replaced Windows backslashes with `os.path.join()`
- [x] **VERIFIED:** UI menu launches successfully
- [x] **VERIFIED:** Basic application functionality working

### üöß Remaining Issues

#### 1. Optional Dependencies (Can be addressed later)
**Priority: LOW**
- [ ] `TTS` - Text-to-speech functionality (Python 3.13 compatibility issues - not critical)

#### 2. Configuration Integration
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- [ ] Qdrant vector database configuration (currently shows warning but app runs)
- [ ] API key integration between `.env` and existing config files

#### 4. Import Path Issues
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- [ ] Relative import paths may not work correctly
- [ ] Need to verify and fix import statements
- [ ] May require restructuring package imports

### üîß Technical Debt

#### 5. Code Quality Issues
**Priority: LOW**
- [ ] Syntax warnings for invalid escape sequences
- [ ] Deprecated function usage warnings
- [ ] Code formatting inconsistencies

#### 6. Configuration Management
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- [ ] API key files in `Aetherius_API/api_keys/` are empty (contain just "1")
- [ ] Need to integrate `.env` file with existing configuration system
- [ ] Verify all API endpoints and configurations

### üìã Next Steps

#### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Fix Critical Dependencies - COMPLETED!
1. ‚úÖ Install missing `aiofiles` package
2. ‚úÖ Resolve Python 3.13 compatibility issues  
3. ‚úÖ Test basic functionality

#### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Cross-Platform Compatibility - COMPLETED!
1. ‚úÖ Fix path separator issues
2. ‚úÖ Update import statements  
3. ‚úÖ Test on macOS

#### üîÑ Phase 3: Configuration Integration (Optional)
1. [ ] Integrate `.env` file with existing config system
2. [ ] Set up Qdrant vector database
3. [ ] Verify all service connections

#### üîÑ Phase 4: Feature Testing & Optimization (Future)
1. [ ] Test all major features (chatbot, memory, agents)
2. [ ] Performance optimization
3. [ ] Documentation updates

### üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Solutions

#### For Python Version Issues:
```bash
# Option 1: Use conda with Python 3.11
conda create -n aetherius python=3.11
conda activate aetherius

# Option 2: Use pyenv to manage Python versions
pyenv install 3.11.7
pyenv local 3.11.7
```

#### For Missing Dependencies:
```bash
# Install missing packages
pip install aiofiles
pip install openai-whisper
```

#### For Path Issues:
- Replace hardcoded paths with `os.path.join()`
- Use `pathlib.Path` for modern path handling
- Test on both Windows and macOS

### üìä Risk Assessment

| Issue | Impact | Effort | Priority |
|-------|--------|--------|----------|
| Missing aiofiles | High | Low | Critical |
| Python 3.13 compatibility | High | Medium | Critical |
| Path separators | Medium | Low | High |
| Import paths | Medium | Medium | High |
| Configuration integration | Low | Medium | Medium |

### üéØ Success Criteria

- [x] All dependencies install without errors
- [x] UI menu launches successfully
- [ ] Basic chat functionality works (requires Qdrant setup)
- [ ] API connections are established (requires API key configuration)
- [x] Cross-platform compatibility verified

### üìù Notes

- The project was originally designed for Windows, requiring adaptation for macOS
- Some packages may need alternative implementations for Python 3.13
- Consider using Docker for consistent environment across platforms
- The `.env` file contains all necessary API keys and should be integrated with the existing configuration system
